# one-shot-envelope-game
A simulation of the one shot envelope game, as described in the work of Christian Hilbe, Moshe Hoffman and Martin A. Nowak in their article "Cooperate without Looking in a Non-Repeated Game" (https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4336/6/4/458). The code reproduces their results and extends the simulation to multiplex networks.
