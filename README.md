# The Multiplex One-shot Envelope Game
The code in this repository contains a **simulation** of the **one-shot envelope game**, as described in the work of **Christian Hilbe**, **Moshe Hoffman** and **Martin A. Nowak** in their article *"Cooperate without Looking in a Non-Repeated Game"* [1]. The code **reproduces** their results and **extends** the simulation to a **multiplex network**. In addition, the simulation is extended to a multiplex network, providing a **framework** for future experimentation and observing different outcomes of the game for different game parameters.

## Simulating the Nash equilibria in a single layer network
According to [1], the one-shot envelope game has the following **Nash equilibria**:
1. Player 1 **looks**, Player 2 **continues** the game and Player 1 **cooperates** if **defection temptation is low** (**ONLYL**)
2. Player one **does not look**, Player 2 **continues** the game and Player 1 **always cooperates** (**CWOL**)
3. Player 2 **always ends** the game, no matter if player 1 looks or not (**EXIT**)

Reproducing the simulations from [1] with this framework yields the following results:

The results are **in-line** with the **theoretical descriptions** of the Nash equilibria. The equilibrium states can be shown even more clearly by plotting a **density matrix** for different game parameters of the one-shot envelope game:

## Extending the game to a multiplex network
The **code** provides the option to run the simulations on a **multiplex network**, where players are allowed to have **different neighbors** and have **different strategies**. In addition, the **game parameters** in each layer may also be **different**. If we repeat the simulation, with the same game parameters in all layers and follow the multiplex **simulation strategy** defined by **Battiston et al.** [2], the following heat maps for the **looking**, **exit** and **cooperation frequencies** are obtained:

We can also plot the **contingency table** for the amount of **unique strategies across layers** players have, before and after they have had the chance to **play** with other players and **copy** their strategies:
